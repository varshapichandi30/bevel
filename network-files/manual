The steps are tested on Ubuntu 20.4. The following is the order of steps execution:
1. Install minikube https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/
2. Start minikube cluster using the following cmd 
   minikube start --memory 16000 --cpus 4 --kubernetes-version=1.19.1 --apiserver-ips=<pubic ip of VM>
3. The ansible controller talks to minikube and for this communication to happen we need to add a proxy. You can set up yourself based    on your choice of proxy. The kubeconfig file need to use the port opened by this proxy. One option is to setup proxy using following     commamd: docker run -d --network minikube -p 18443:18443 chevdor/nginx-minikube-proxy
This port 18443 needs to be opened on the VM for communication. Please refer article https://www.chevdor.com/post/2021/02/docker_to_k8s/
4. Setup Hashicorp vault (https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/getting-started/getting-started-install)
5. Open another terminal and start local vault using following command:
   vault server -dev -dev-root-token-id root -dev-listen-address 0.0.0.0:8200
   One can also use helm charts for vault and do the operations as mentioned in the Workshop series here:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKMDgKshjQ8&list=PL0MZ85B_96CFJUzic2ZF9rposfx2hr2rm&index=2	
6. Clone the Hyperledger Bevel repo and build ansible controller using command docker build . -t bevel-build
8. Open another terminal and cd to bevel directory then start ansible controller container using command 
   docker run -it -v $(pwd):/home/bevel/ bevel-build /bin/bash
9. One needs to ensure that git config is setup
   git config --global user.name "UserName"
   git config --global user.email "UserEmailAddress"
10. Use bevel documentation to ensure that Network.yaml is updated for vault, minikube and git repo details

After this steps one can run the ansible-playbook to setup Hyperledger Fabric network on minkube.
